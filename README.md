# Predicting mpg
A notebook on prediction mpg (miles per galon)  taking into account the characteristics of the car

Using the dataset "Car performance data" we will try to create a model to predict car consumption efficiency (MPG or miles per gallon)

Different approaches can be used to tackle the problem, but in this notebook we will do the following:
* Get our data
* Run a exploratory data analysis on our data
* Use linear regression to build our models
* Analyse multicolinearity
* Finish with a conclusion and insights on other models that can be used
We will use the linear regression mode to predict the value of **mpg** and then deduce in which category tha car falls.
